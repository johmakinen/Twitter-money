File data_2018_2020.json has Donald Trump's latest tweets from 10.01.2018 to 11.01.2020  
File data.py is for data cleaning and preprocessing  

  
## **TODO**:   
  
**Data**
  
Y_data individually by stock  
X_data include all important words  

**Regression**:
  Choose ML algorithms: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.ensemble  
  Figure out metrics
  Compare algos
  Result representation

**Additional***
  Maybe process tweet -> stock_data differently?
  Simulate stock buys to see if viable
